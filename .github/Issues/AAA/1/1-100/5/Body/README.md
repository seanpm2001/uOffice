#### [Task] find and upload the old version

The Java draft version of this program needs to be uploaded. Although not a useful feature, it is historical. I can't tell if it was proprietary or not, that may have been another project (I assume a currency project) it was never publicly released, so when it is released, it will be classified as free and open source.
