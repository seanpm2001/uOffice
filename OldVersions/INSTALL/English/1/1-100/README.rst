Installing this Office production suite (uOffice) project by @seanpm2001
---

This project currently doesn't have to be installed to be viewed, and currently doesn't require installation, it is not yet production ready. Some parts are functional, but they are not functional for the intended purpose yet.

The current included languages include:

Python (heavy requirement)

Visual Basic Script (for 16 bit and 32 bit versions of Windows, not required)

Java (For the original version, not required, as it is not maintained)

---
Linux
---

This project is cross-platform. Linux installation isn't too difficult. You just need to have Python 3.0 or later installed to run the files.

If you use Ubuntu, Fedora, or another Linux system that supports the snapcraft version, and provided you don't hate snaps, you can also use a snapcraft version. If you want to view the original version, you will need to have Java 8 or higher installed.

The visual basic dialog prompts likely won't work, as (as far as I know) you can't get VBS to work on Linux. It is a 16/32 bit Windows only feature, and is not required, as it isn't linked anywhere.

---
MacOS
---

This project is cross-platform. MacOS installation isn't too difficult. You just need to have Python 3.0 or later installed to run the files.

If you want to view the original version, you will need to have Java 8 or higher installed.

BSD

This project is cross-platform. BSD installation isn't too difficult. You just need to have Python 3.0 or later installed to run the files.

If you want to view the original version, you will need to have Java 8 or higher installed.

The visual basic dialog prompts likely won't work, as (as far as I know) you can't get VBS to work on MacOS. It is a 16/32 bit Windows only feature, and is not required, as it isn't linked anywhere.

---
Windows
---

The small original portions of this project were written on Windows 10. You do not need Windows 10 to run these portions, Linux, MacOS, and BSD will also work provided you have Python 3 installed. The visual basic based dialog boxes are not required, and are a separate extra feature. They do not work on Windows 11 or higher.

If you want to view the original version, you will need to have Java 8 or higher installed.

---
Other operating system
---

This project is cross-platform. You may have difficulty getting it to run on an unsupported operating system, but it isn't impossible. You just need the Python 3.0 (or later) package installed.

If you want to view the original version, you will need to have Java 8 or higher installed. It may be difficult to get a Java Runtime environment to work on most uncommon operating systems.

The visual basic dialog prompts likely won't work, as (as far as I know) you can't get VBS to work on most operating systems. It is a 16/32 bit Windows only feature, and is not required, as it isn't linked anywhere.

Currently, Linux, MacOS, BSD, and Windows are supported. You may not be able to get this program to work on an operating system like Solaris, Fuchsia, ReactOS, etc. but it isn't impossible.

images and other files
---

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in PNG, JPG, and SVG formats. Make sure your computer can handle images of 2560x1440/2560x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle PNG, JPG, and SVG files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, and PNG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
